## Unsupervised Learning
### Project: Customer Segmentation
#### Background
In this project, I worked with real-life data provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify faces of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.

For the project, I used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population data into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.

#### List of files
`Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`: this is the Jupyter Notebook in which the entire project resides; due to the "real-life" nature of the data, there are specific T&Cs which prohibit students from keeping the data after completion of the project. Thus, only the process itself will be provided in this repo without the dataset.
`Identify_Customer_Segments.html`: this is the HTML version of the notebook.
